1. The object of this memory game is to click on each image only once and click on all 12 images in succession without forgetting which images have already been clicked.

2. The application renders different cartoon images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an card image is clicked, the images rendered to the page and shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game is restarted.

6. The application is deployed to Github Pages.
